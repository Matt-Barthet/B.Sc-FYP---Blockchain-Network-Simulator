# ICT 3907: Final Year Project in Computing Science
This project wraps up the third year of the Computing Science course at the University of Malta.  This project's artefact is a stochastic, discrete-event simulator for blockchain network and is written in the Python 3.6 programming language.

## Project Aims
This project aims to expand upon existing research in the following (non-exhaustive) ways:
1) Modelling Transactions lyaer of the Ledger.
2) Modelling the virtual machine to simulate smart contract run-time.
